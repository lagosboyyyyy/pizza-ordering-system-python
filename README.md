# Pizza Ordering System

## Overview
This project is a simple, interactive command-line application that simulates a pizza ordering service. Developed in Python, it allows users to customize their pizza by selecting a size and adding toppings, after which it calculates and displays the total bill. This system is a practical demonstration of fundamental programming concepts, particularly conditional logic and user input handling.

## Features
* **Customizable Pizza Sizes:** Users can choose between Small (S), Medium (M), and Large (L) pizza sizes.
* **Optional Pepperoni Topping:** Add pepperoni to any pizza, with a price adjustment based on pizza size.
* **Optional Extra Cheese:** Users can opt for an additional layer of cheese for a small extra cost.
* **Automatic Bill Calculation:** The system instantly calculates the total cost based on the chosen size and toppings.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line prompts guide the user through the ordering process.

## Code Structure Highlights
The core logic of the program is implemented using a series of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. This conditional flow effectively manages the pricing based on user selections for size and toppings. User inputs are handled using the `input()` function, and the final bill is calculated by summing up the `base_price`, `pepperoni_cost`, and `cheese_cost`.

## Future Enhancements & AI/ML Opportunities
As a data scientist focused on AI/ML, I see several exciting avenues for extending this basic system. These future features could leverage more advanced concepts:

* **Recommendation System:** Implement a basic recommendation engine that suggests pizza combinations or popular add-ons based on historical user choices or overall trends. This could involve simple collaborative filtering or content-based recommendations.
* **Delivery Route Optimization:** For a more complex system, integrate algorithms to calculate the most efficient delivery paths for multiple orders. This would involve graph theory and optimization techniques (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, Traveling Salesperson Problem heuristics).
* **Dynamic Pricing:** Explore machine learning models to dynamically adjust pizza prices based on factors like demand (time of day/week), ingredient availability, or even local events.
* **User Accounts and Order History:** Develop a system to store user data and past orders, enabling personalized experiences and analytics on popular items.
* **Inventory Management:** Simulate ingredient stock levels and use predictive models to forecast ingredient needs based on sales patterns.
